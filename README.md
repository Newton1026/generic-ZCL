# generic-ZCL
Generic ZigBee Cluster Library. It's my undergrad final year project. The goal of the project was to develop a library to make development of ZigBee base IoT device faster and more portable, also use concepts which I learned during my training, like Socket programming, IPC, threading cross compilation etc.  This code is just POC of initial thought.
